# SPIDER
- project: "SPIDER: Selective Plotting of Interconnected Data and Entity Relations"
  role: Team Lead & Primary Developer
  duration: 2019
  url: https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14416
  description: "SPIDER is a web application that can be remotely-accessed via a web browser, and has three major components: (1) a <mark>Java</mark> API that reads documents, extracts entities and relationships using Stanford CoreNLP, (2) a <mark>Neo4j</mark> graph database that stores entities, relationships, and properties; (3) a <mark>JavaScript</mark>-based SigmaJS visualization tool for displaying the graph on the browser. SPIDER can scale document analysis to thousands of files for quick visualization, making the intelligence analysis process more efficient, and allowing military leadership quicker insights into a vast array of potentially-hidden knowledge."

# AOS warpage
- project: "An investigation of infill process variables to reduce warpage in fused deposition modeling"
  role: Primary Researcher
  duration: 2018 - 2020
  url: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xgFpv0FzKGzWrE8ysxl0vrTlmEcODwZb/view"
  description: "I studied warpage, the distortion of parts in 3D printing, and attempted to find printing parameters that would reduce warpage. I built multiple mathematical models to analyze the warpage problem based on thermal isotropy and the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm."
