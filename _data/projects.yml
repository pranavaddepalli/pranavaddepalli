    Currently, three-dimensional (3D) printing is being widely used for rapid prototyping and Just in Time manufacturing. Many commercial 3D printers use fused deposition modeling (FDM), a printing technique where a solid thermoplastic filament is melted and extruded onto sequential two-dimensional layers to produce a 3D object. In FDM printing, thermal stresses between layers due to inhomogeneous thermal conduction during cycles of heating and cooling create distortions, known as warpage. Various process variables, especially infill density and infill pattern, cause thermal properties to become anisotropic because of thermal conduction through plastic and natural convection in air gaps. In order to identify the effect of these process variables on thermal warpage, Polylactic Acid (PLA) discs with varying infill densities and patterns were printed and the spatiotemporal temperature distribution was modeled. Trajectory similarity analysis using the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm as well as a temperature gradient analysis with statistical tests were conducted. With p-values below 0.0001, it was found that trihexagonal infill patterns had more isotropic temperature distributions when compared to rectilinear patterns. In addition, also with p-values below 0.0001, 20% infill was found to have the least isotropic heat distribution when compared to 30% and 10% infill, with 30% being the best. The results of the dynamic time warping algorithm show that with increase in the infill density, the effect of the choice of infill pattern on the temperature distribution reduces significantly. Based on the analysis of the data, this study recommends that 30% infill density and trihexagonal infill pattern be used in FDM printing with PLA to mitigate warpage.

    Intelligence analysts have long struggled with an abundance of data that must be investigated on a daily basis. In the U.S. Army, this activity involves reconciling information from various sources, a process that has been automated to a certain extent, but which remains highly manual. To promote automation, a semantic analysis prototype was designed to aid in the intelligence analysis process. This tool, called Selective Plotting of Interconnected Data and Entity Relations (SPIDER), extracts entities and their relationships from text in order to streamline investigations. SPIDER is a web application that can be remotely-accessed via a web browser, and has three major components: (1) a <mark>Java</mark> API that reads documents, extracts entities and relationships using Stanford CoreNLP, (2) a <mark>Neo4j</mark> graph database that stores entities, relationships, and properties; (3) a <mark>JavaScript</mark>-based SigmaJS visualization tool for displaying the graph on the browser. SPIDER can scale document analysis to thousands of files for quick visualization, making the intelligence analysis process more efficient, and allowing military leadership quicker insights into a vast array of potentially-hidden knowledge.

    py-stocks is a module for retrieving real-time stock data, historical stock data, and stock technical indicators. py-stocks is a wrapper package aimed towards developers looking for a single package for collecting and using both historical and real-time data. It integrates the yfinance and stockqoutes modules as well as the capability to collect news articles directly from NASDAQ.
